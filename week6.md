### Basic Operations

- **Addition (+):** Combine numbers together. For instance: `2 + 3 = 5`
- **Subtraction (-):** Determine the difference between numbers. For instance: `5 - 2 = 3`
- **Multiplication (\*):** Perform repeated addition. For instance: `2 * 3 = 6`
- **Division (/):** Divide one number by another. For instance: `6 / 2 = 3`

### Order of Operations

In arithmetic expressions, the order of operations is crucial:
1. **Parentheses:** Perform operations inside parentheses first.
2. **Exponents:** Evaluate expressions involving exponents or powers.
3. **Multiplication and Division:** Perform these operations from left to right.
4. **Addition and Subtraction:** Similarly, perform these operations from left to right.


```python
# Multiply and add numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
num3 = 2

# Multiplication
result_multiply = num1 * num2 * num3
print(f"The result of multiplying {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is: {result_multiply}")

# Addition
result_addition = num1 + num2 + num3
print(f"The result of adding {num1}, {num2}, and {num3} is: {result_addition}")

```

    The result of multiplying 5, 3, and 2 is: 30
    The result of adding 5, 3, and 2 is: 10
    


```python
# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120  # Change this value to the number of minutes you want to convert

# Conversion
hours = minutes / 60

# Display the result
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours")

```

    120 minutes is equal to 2.0 hours
    

## Objectives
